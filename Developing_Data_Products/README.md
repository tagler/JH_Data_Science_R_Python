## What is Quarterback Passer Rating?

Quarterback passer rating is a sports statistic. It is the measure of the performance of quarterbacks in American football. There are two formulas currently in use: one used by the National Football League (NFL) and the other used in NCAA college football. Passer rating is calculated using a player's passing attempts, completions, yards, touchdowns (TDs), and interceptions (INTs).

Since 1973, passer rating has been the official formula used by the NFL to determine its passing leader.

Passer rating in the NFL is on a scale from 0 to 158.3.

Passing efficiency in NCAA college football is on a scale from -731.6 to 1261.6.
